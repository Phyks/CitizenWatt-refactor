CitizenWatt-refactor
====================

This is an updated version of [CitizenWatt](http://citizenwatt.paris/) code,
aiming to be a backup of available stuff, with minor updates for anyone
willing to build its own.

CitizenWatt aimed at building a personal DIY energy consumption meter,
inspired by [OpenEnergyMonitor](https://openenergymonitor.org/).

I recently came across cloned CitizenWatt repositories and wanted to make some
lifting of the code, while I set it back in place at home. I also found out
that OpenEnergyMonitor was considerably nicer than it used to be, especially
from a UX point of view. This aims at being an up to date merge of
OpenEnergyMonitor and CitizenWatt, to be the best combination possible at the
moment, in my opinion.

This is part of a home automation process, hence the will to avoid installing
pre-compiled images which are not easily extensible.
